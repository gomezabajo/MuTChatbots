- A kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors\U0001D431       x and\U0001D432y in some (possibly very high dimensional) feature space, which  is why kernel functions are sometimes called “generalized dot product” -  The kernel trick is a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear  problem by transforming linearly inseparable data to linearly separable ones  in a higher dimension.
