utter_missing_data
- First I would conduct EDA — Exploratory Data Analysis to clean, explore,  and understand my data.See my article on EDA here.As part of my EDA, I could  compose a histogram of the duration of calls to see the underlying distribution. - My guess is that the duration of calls would follow a log normal distribution  (see below). The reason that I believe it’s positively skewed is because the  lower end is limited to 0 since a call can’t be negative seconds. However,  on the upper end, it’s likely for there to be a small proportion of calls  that are extremely long relatively. - You could use a QQ plot to confirm  whether the duration of calls follows a log normal distribution or not
