- Selection bias is the phenomenon of selecting individuals, groups or  data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved,  ultimately resulting in a sample that is not representative of the population. - Understanding and identifying selection bias is important because it can significantly  skew results and provide false insights about a particular population group. - Types of selection bias include: - sampling bias: a biased sample caused  by non-random sampling time interval: selecting a specific time frame that  supports the desired conclusion. e.g. conducting a sales analysis near Christmas.exposure:  includes clinical susceptibility bias, protopathic bias, indication bias.data:  includes cherry-picking, suppressing evidence, and the fallacy of incomplete  evidence.attrition: attrition bias is similar to survivorship bias, where  only those that ‘survived’ a long process are included in an analysis, or  failure bias, where those that ‘failed’ are only included observer selection:  related to the Anthropic principle, which is a philosophical consideration  that any data we collect about the universe is filtered by the fact that,  in order for it to be observable, it must be compatible with the conscious  and sapient life that observes it. [3] - Handling missing data can make selection  bias worse because different methods impact the data in different ways. For  example, if you replace null values with the mean of the data, you adding  bias in the sense that you’re assuming that the data is not as spread out  as it might actually be.
