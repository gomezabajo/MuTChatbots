- Boxplot vs Histogram - While boxplots and histograms are visualizations   used to show the distribution of the data, they communicate information differently.        - Histograms are bar charts that show the frequency of a numerical variable’s   values and are used to approximate the probability distribution of the given   variable. It allows you to quickly understand the shape of the distribution,   the variation, and potential outliers. - Boxplots communicate different aspects   of the distribution of data. While you can’t see the shape of the distribution   through a box plot, you can gather other information like the quartiles, the   range, and outliers. Boxplots are especially useful when you want to compare   multiple charts at the same time because they take up less space than histograms.
