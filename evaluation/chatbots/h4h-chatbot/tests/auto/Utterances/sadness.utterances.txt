sadness
I've been feeling sadness When I get around a particular person or when I go home, I'm just sad or irritated. 
How do I talk about my feelings of depression, and to who do I talk to? 
I have long spurts of depression, anxiety, and need change constantly why? 
Why do I feel sad all the time? 
is it normal not to feel empathy? 
How can I deal with my depression? 
How do I make myself happy without someone who made me happy? 
I feel sad. 
I feel like my existence is meaningless I've been depressed for quite a while. 
I'm feeling really down lately 
I've been feeling sad and unmotivated 
Everything feels overwhelming 
I'm struggling to find joy in anything 
I feel hopeless and alone 
I can't shake this feeling of sadness 
I feel like I'm stuck in a rut 
I'm having a hard time getting out of bed in the morning 
I feel like no one understands what I'm going through
