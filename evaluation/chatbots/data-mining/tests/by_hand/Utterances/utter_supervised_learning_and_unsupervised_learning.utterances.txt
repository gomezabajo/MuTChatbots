utter_supervised_learning_and_unsupervised_learning
- Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps an input to  an output based on example input-output pairs. - For example, if I had a  dataset with two variables, age (input) and height (output), I could implement  a supervised learning model to predict the height of a person based on their  age. - Unlike supervised learning,unsupervised learning is used to draw inferences  and find patterns from input data without references to labeled outcomes.  A common use of unsupervised learning is grouping customers by purchasing  behavior to find target markets.
