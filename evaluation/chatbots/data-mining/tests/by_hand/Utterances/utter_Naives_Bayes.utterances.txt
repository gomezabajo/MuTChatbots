utter_Naives_Bayes 
A naive Bayes classifier is an algorithm that uses Bayes' theorem to classify objects. Naive Bayes classifiers assume strong, or naive, independence between attributes of data points. Popular uses of naive Bayes classifiers include spam filters, text analysis and medical diagnosis. These classifiers are widely used for machine learning because they are simple to implement. Naive Bayes is also known as simple Bayes or independence Bayes.
