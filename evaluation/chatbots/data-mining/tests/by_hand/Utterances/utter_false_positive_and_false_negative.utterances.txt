utter_false_positive_and_false_negative
- A false positive is an incorrect identification of the presence of a  condition when it’s absent. - A false negative is an incorrect identification  of the absence of a condition when it’s actually present. - An example of  when false negatives are more important than false positives is when screening  for cancer. It’s much worse to say that someone doesn’t have cancer when they  do, instead of saying that someone does and later realizing that they don’t.        - This is a subjective argument, but false positives can be worse than false  negatives from a psychological point of view. For example, a false positive  for winning the lottery could be a worse outcome than a false negative because  people normally don’t expect to win the lottery anyways.
