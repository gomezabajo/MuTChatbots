- Along-tailed distribution is a type of heavy-tailed distribution that  has a tail (or tails) that drop off gradually and asymptotically. - 3 practical  examples include the power law, the Pareto principle (more commonly known  as the 80–20 rule), and product sales (i.e. best selling products vs others).     - It’s important to be mindful of long-tailed distributions in classification  and regression problems because the least frequently occurring values make  up the majority of the population. This can ultimately change the way that  you deal with outliers, and it also conflicts with some machine learning techniques  with the assumption that the data is normally distributed.
