utter_decision_tree 
Decision trees are a popular model, used in operations research, strategic planning, and machine learning. Each square above is called anode, and the more nodes you have, the more accurate your decision tree will be (generally). The last nodes of the decision tree, where a decision is made, are called the leaves of the tree. Decision trees are intuitive and easy to build but fall short when it comes to accuracy.
