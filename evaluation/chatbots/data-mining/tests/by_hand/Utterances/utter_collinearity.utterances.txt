utter_collinearity
- Multicollinearity exists when an independent variable is highly correlated  with another independent variable in a multiple regression equation. This  can be problematic because it undermines the statistical significance of an  independent variable. - You could use the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF)  to determine if there is any multicollinearity between independent variables  â€” a standard benchmark is that if the VIF is greater than 5 then multicollinearity  exists.
