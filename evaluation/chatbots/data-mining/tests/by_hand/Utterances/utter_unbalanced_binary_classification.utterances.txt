utter_unbalanced_binary_classification
- There are a number of ways to handle unbalanced binary classification  (assuming that you want to identify the minority class): - First, you want  to reconsider the metrics that you’d use to evaluate your model. The accuracy  of your model might not be the best metric to look at because and I’ll use  an example to explain why. Let’s say 99 bank withdrawals were not fraudulent  and 1 withdrawal was. If your model simply classified every instance as “not  fraudulent”, it would have an accuracy of 99%! Therefore, you may want to  consider using metrics like precision and recall. - Another method to improve  unbalanced binary classification is by increasing the cost of misclassifying  the minority class. By increasing the penalty of such, the model should classify  the minority class more accurately. - Lastly, you can improve the balance  of classes by oversampling the minority class or by under sampling the majority  class
